When receiving, should timestamps be collected before or after read?
When sending, should timestamps be collected before for after write?
Within callbacks, the state machine can be driven multiple times if it's state stays being "running". Keep driving until the state is no longer "running" is probably not a good idea. For when the load is high, this may create too much bursts. So either set an upper limit or use random decisions.
